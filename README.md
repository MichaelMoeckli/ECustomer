# ECustomer

Made with a lot of help at school :)


In this action we use the classical data database connection to
MySQL with the JDBC DriverConnection, for this we need the driver of the database. In this case we need
to install the MySQL Driver (MySQL Java Connector). 

ECustomer/src/main/java/ch/bbw/ecustomer/CustomerDao.java
